This is a repositpry for the 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO project of ALX SWE done by, Kelvin Thuo and Caleb Muthama.
# NOTES

- LIFO (__Last In, First Out__) is a principle of managing data storage where last element added
  is the first element out. Commonly associated with stacks.
- FIFO (__First In, First Out__) is a principle of managing data storage where first element added
  is the first element out. Commonly associated with queues.
- Stack is a data structure that follows LIFO principle.
- Common characteristics of a stack:
	* Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
	* Pop: Remove an element from the top of the stack.
	* Peek: View the top element from the top without removing it.
	* Empty Stack
- Scenarios that stacks are used:
	1. Function call management
	2. Expression evaluation
	3. Undo and Redo
	4. Momery management
	5. Parsing
	6. Backtracking algorithms
- Queue is a data structure that follows FIFO principle.
- Key characteristics of keys:
	* Enqueue: Add an element to the back of the queue.
	* Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
	* Peek: View the front element without removing it.
	* Empty Queue
- Queues are used in:
	1. Task scheduling
	2. Print spooling
	3. Breadth-First Search
	4. Task management
	5. Order processing
- Global variables are declared outside any function or block.
- Bytecode is a low-level representation of a program's code that is designed to executed by an interpreter.
- An opcode is like a command code that tells the computer's 'brain' what specific action to perform.
